Microsimulation
===============

Microsimulation is (as defined by the `International Microsimulation Association
<http://www.microsimulation.org/>`_), a modelling technique that operates at the level of individual units such as persons, households, vehicles or firms. Each unit has a set of associated attributes – e.g. each person in the model has an associated age, sex, marital and employment status. At each time step, a set of rules (intended to represent individual preferences and tendencies) are applied to these units leading to simulated changes in state and possibly behavior. These rules may be deterministic (probability = 1), such as aging, or stochastic (probability <= 1), such as the chance of dying, marrying, giving birth or moving within a given time period.

The aim of such simulations is to give insight about both the overall aggregate change of some characteristics and (importantly) the way these changes are distributed in the population that is being modeled.
