This software has been supported by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity - PROGRESS (2007-2013) - and the Luxembourgish General Inspectorate of Social Security (Inspection Générale de la Sécurité Sociale, IGSS).

The PROGRESS programme is implemented by the European Commission. It was established to financially support the implementation of the objectives of the European Union in the employment, social affairs and equal opportunities area, and thereby contribute to the achievement of the Europe 2020 Strategy goals in these fields.

The seven-year Programme targets all stakeholders who can help shape the development of appropriate and effective employment and social legislation and policies, across the EU-27, EFTA-EEA and EU candidate and pre-candidate countries.

The general objective of the PROGRESS/MiDaL project is to “develop an advanced analysis tool that allows Luxembourg and other countries at answering policy-related questions about pensions and social transfers in the longer term trough microsimulation models. (PROGRESS-MiDaL: detailed description of the action and time schedule, 2009, 1).

LIAM 2 is the result of intense collaboration between individual researchers from various institutions. It is primarily being developed at the Federal Planning Bureau by Gaëtan de Menten, in close collaboration with Geert Bryon. Gijs Dekkers coordinates this part of the MiDaL project, provides methodological information on microsimulation, and created the synthetic starting data set. Raphaël Desmet takes the lead in testing of LIAM 2 and model development.

The Luxembourg Team (Philippe Liégeois and Fréderic Berger (CEPS/INSTEAD) and Raymond Wagener (IGSS)) play a major role in the use and testing of LIAM 2 in the Luxembourg context. In addition, Philippe Liégeois holds general management of the MiDaL project, and the IGSS provided partial funding equal to 20% of the budget.

Cathal O’Donoghue provides methodological information on microsimulation techniques and shared the source code of the first version of LIAM, which the FPB used in the AIM project.
