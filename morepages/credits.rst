LIAM2 is the result of ongoing collaboration between individual researchers
from the Federal Planning Bureau (FPB) in Belgium, CEPS/INSTEAD and the General
Inspectorate of Social Security (Inspection Générale de la Sécurité Sociale,
IGSS) in Luxembourg.

The software package is primarily being developed at the Federal Planning
Bureau by Gaëtan de Menten and Geert Bryon. Testing and model development is
done by Raphaël Desmet and Gijs Dekkers (FPB), Philippe Liégeois and Fréderic
Berger (CEPS/INSTEAD) and Raymond Wagener (IGSS). Finally, Cathal O'Donoghue
shared the source code of the first version of LIAM, which the FPB used in the
AIM project (Dekkers et al., 2010).

It was initially the result of the MiDaL project (December 2009 - November
2011), "Towards the development of a dynamic Microsimulation toolbox « LIAM-II »
and the complementary implementation of administrative Data needed for dynamic
microsimulation of pensions in Luxembourg". The general objective of the
project was to "develop an advanced analysis tool that allows Luxembourg and
other countries at answering policy-related questions about pensions and social
transfers in the longer term trough microsimulation models. The project received
funding from both the European Community Programme for Employment and Social
Solidarity - PROGRESS (2007-2013), under the Grant VS/2009/0569, and the General
Inspectorate for Social Security (IGSS) of Luxembourg.

The PROGRESS programme was created by the European Commission to financially
support the implementation of the objectives of the European Union in the
employment, social affairs and equal opportunities areas. For more information
