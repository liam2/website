LIAM2 is on GitHub
==================

The source code for LIAM2 is now hosted on GitHub:

https://github.com/liam2/liam2/

This offers many advantages over what we did previously (create a
snapshot of the code each time a new version is released):

* one can follow the development as it happens (see what changed at any time,
  browse the source code at any revision, ...)
* much easier integration of external contributions
* more visibility for liam2
* and much more...

Enjoy!
