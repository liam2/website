Highlights of this release are support for weights in all aggregate functions, choice() with probabilities which
can be different per individual (e.g. depending on gender), the ability to load globals mid-simulation, the possibility
to do simulations without any .h5 output file, global constants and a lot of minor improvements and fixes.
